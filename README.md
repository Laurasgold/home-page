My Awesome Project
My portfolio was designed and built completely from scratch, giving information about myself and my work, andthe ability to contact me.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Svelte.kit

I designed the website from start to finish, taking into consideration the looks or code I have not mastered. I wanted to give myself challenges while making something clean, simple, and aesthetic. I wanted to challenge myself without overwhelming myself with a first start-to-end project. I enjoyed finding tools and methods to keep files organized as well as helping in the future when I come back to look at this project I can pick things up easier vs trying to find where I put certain aspects of code. I enjoyed learning how Svelte is organized and optimized the code. 

Optimizations
creating a good foundation by setting up styles, clamp font, and organized sections for each aspect of the website, made things so much smoother and, easier to use down the line


Lessons Learned:
Since this was the first project  I built on my own, it was an incredibly frustrating fun journey. I appreciated that there isn't just one way to do things and that pivoting to optimize or get the best result will happen consistently. This was a good way to practice and learn how Svelte.Kit works and practicing my code in general.
